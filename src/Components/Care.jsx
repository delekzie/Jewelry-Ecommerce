            <p>- The more intentional you are about caring for your jewelry, the longer it will last.</p>
            <p>- As a general care tip, your jewelry should be the last thing you put on before going out and the first thing you remove upon coming home.</p>
            <p>- Remove your jewellery before doing any activity that risks physical damage.</p>

         <p>- Proactive maintenance is the easiest way to care for your jewelry.</p>
         <p>- Regularly cleaning your pieces helps to avoid the residue buildup that can dull the original shine.</p>
         <p>- To maintain the shine of your jewelry, gently clean it with a soft-bristled brush or cloth using warm water and detergent-free soap.</p>
         <p>- Keep your jewellery away from extreme temperatures, humidity or sunlight.</p>
         <p>- Avoid spraying perfumes and applying creams or any other liquids directly onto your jewellery.</p>
         <p>- Store your jewellery in a soft pouch or suitably lined box.</p>
         <p> - All our sterling silver products are protected with an anti‑tarnish solution to help prevent tarnish.</p>

            <h1 className='my-3'> How To Repair</h1>
            <p>Your pieces may age as you wear them throughout the time, however our whole premise is to build a brand with pieces that you take on your journey and that age with you. Should your Atelier Romy piece require a repair or a rebirth, we would be very happy to work with you to bring your piece ‘back to life’. We can replace a lost stone, repolish, replete and even dip your pieces in a new colour plating. Please email us your requests at romy@atelierromy.com</p>
